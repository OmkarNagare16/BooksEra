## 📋 Tasks:

We have implemented the feature of tasks because there are many users who are using different task manager application for managing the tasks and also using an application for their needs. This feature will help BooksEra’s member to manage the tasks and to manage their work as well in the same android application. This feature will allow user to add, update or delete those tasks and also it provides the facility of due date. User will be able to delete those tasks as well as user can edit those tasks and due dates. To make this feature more friendly BooksEra provides user the facility of managing those using swiping. For example, if user wants to Edit or update any task then user can edit that particular task just by swiping that task to the right side and BooksEra will allow user to edit that task. If user want to delete that task, then user can swipe that task toward the left side and it will generate a warning as the confirmation for delete that task. These tasks are shown in the list format with the due date as well and user can mark them as done. It will help users to keep a track on the completed tasks.

## 🔖 Sign out:

Signing out helps prevent other users from accessing the system without verifying their credentials. It also helps protect the current user's access or prevent unauthorized actions on the current login session and is thus an important part of security. Signing out means to end access to an android application. Logging out informs the application that the current user wishes to end the login session. The period between the login and the logout is the duration of the login session, which is the period that a user can perform his/her actions. Thank you! 🍃
